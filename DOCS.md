3. **Select AI Model**:

## 5. Troubleshooting

- **Slow Generation**: If draft generation seems slow, it may be due to high demand or network issues. Try again after a short wait.
- **Error Messages**: If you see an error message, read it carefully. It may provide information about what went wrong and how to fix it.
- **No Drafts Generated**: Ensure your song idea is clear and specific. Very vague ideas might not produce good results.
